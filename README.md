## Register Meetings
Pulls meetings from an Outlook Exchange server and creates a Wunderlist task for each of them.

**NOTE:** There's an error in the pyexchange library with connecting to the exchange server (in its connection.py file) because SSL is forced to be verified. 
See: https://github.com/linkedin/pyexchange/issues/53 for more info.
